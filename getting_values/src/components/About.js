      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>
        The New Orleans Charter Science and Mathematics High School is an
        open-admission public charter school that prepares all students for
        college admissions and successful careers. Sci High provides a rigorous
        high school curriculum with an emphasis in science and mathematics in a
        supportive environment of learning and respect that prepares students to
        make informed choices about post-secondary pursuits.

      <h1>HISTORY</h1>
      <h2>The New Orleans Center for Science & Mathematics</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 1993 the New Orleans Center for Science & Math (SciHigh)
        operated as a half-day program within the Orleans Parish School System
        offering specialized instruction in science, math, and technology, and
        providing an open door to any interested New Orleans high school
        student. Students attended partner schools for their other graduation
        requirements. The guiding principle: that students with a broad range of
        scholastic aptitudes can master science and mathematics concepts and
        information at a high level given the proper culture, faculty, and
        school leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sci High students proved us right, consistently doing as well or better
        than students in the selective Orleans Parish magnet schools, even
        though we were not selective in our admissions. They gave us evidence
        that even those students with weak academic preparation and a broad
        range of scholastic aptitudes can master science and mathematics
        concepts, given a culture of high expectations and respect for work and
        one another.

      <h1>2006</h1>
      <p>
        The post-Katrina public high school situation dictated a different model
        for SciHigh. There were only four public high schools open after the
        flood. Previously, there had been 22, all of which had served as feeder
        schools for Sci High. The demand for a half-day program had been
        destroyed. Therefore, in October 2005, a mere 60 days after the collapse
        of the New Orleans levee system, The Advocates for Science & Mathematics
        Education, Inc. applied for and was granted a Type III charter by the
        Orleans Parish School Board. Now the founding Advocates had full
        responsibility for the finances and operations of their successful
        model.

      <p>
        <b>Sci High at Albert Wicker School</b> <br></br>
        Responding to the new environment, the half-day program became a
        full-day program offering all subjects that are required for graduation.
        The high school moved from the Delgado campus to Allen School, a former
        elementary building, at the corner of Nashville and Loyola avenues.
